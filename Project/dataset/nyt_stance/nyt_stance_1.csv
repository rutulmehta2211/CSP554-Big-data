Increasing insurance costs yet again for doctors, nurses and others in the field.

Adding to the costs of health care once again-just what we all need.

Simple solution: get vaccinated.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,unclear,pro-mitigation
"Employers should also be thinking about the risk unvaccinated employees bring for their colleagues and customers. If I'm forced to work in person and am infected by a colleague who refused to vaccinated for personal reasons, I would hold both that individual AND my employer accountable for not providing a safe working environment. 

Mandating vaccines is the right thing to do for our SHARED future. American individualism needs to see itself out the door here if we ever want COVID out of our lives.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"What about people who have already had the virus and have developed antibodies naturally?

This is just as good as having the vaccination, and many scientists think it is even better, as you have been exposed to the whole virus.

A positive antibody test should count as much as having the vaccination.",anti-mitigation,unclear,pro-mitigation,unclear
"In the USA we are already divided by wealth, religion, and race. Vaccination status may turn out to be yet another way of separating us into different groups if the reports one reads about vaccinnated people preferring only the company of other vaccinated people are true. Additionally, businesses such as theaters permitting only vaccinated customers will only add to this. As I believe as many people as possible should be vaccinated I think mixtures of coercion and monetary gain are justified.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"Masks were the LEAST oppressive part of this pandemic.  

I got no colds, no flu, and no COVID.

The only reason people are opposing masks and vaccines is because they hate the thinking half of the country that is willing to endure a minimal amount of discomfort for themselves, their families, and for the community.

Preventative measures and vaccines were a gift that saved lives. 

I almost root for the virus to become more deadly to the anti-vaccine, anti-mask crowd.   These stubborn, selfish people are wrecking everything for everyone else.  There's more than one way to get to herd immunity.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"What is so hard to understand about a policy of ""No Mask Requirement with Proof of Vaccination"" ?

If you don't want to vax you don't get fired, but you just need to mask up. I don't think that violates anyone's Constitutional rights.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,anti-mitigation,unclear
"I suspect that most, and almost certainly all, anti-vaccers use good hygiene (i.e. wash their hands) after using the bathroom and they do it so they don’t get sick and get others sick with E. coli and other pathogens. Vaccines utilize the same desired outcomes. Makes me wonder why anti-vaccers continue to use good post bathroom hygiene if they don’t care about their health and the health of others? Maybe ask the next anti-vaccer that you encounter that query.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,unclear,pro-mitigation
"soon covid19 will be known in the usa as the trump virus, as only trump supporters (and uneducated- often the same crowd) will need hospitalization from it.  i just hope that they have private insurance.",unclear,unclear,anti-mitigation,unclear
"Obviously more Big Brother. Companies requiriig vacccines would be way over the line and surely illegal as a condition of employment. Everyone just stop and breathe deeply. Case counts are plummeting, as are hospitalizations and deaths. We have obviously reached herd immunity or are on the verge.",anti-mitigation,unclear,anti-mitigation,anti-mitigation
"Not even half of this country is fully vaccinated.

The Delta variant has been gaining momentum since March.

Every medical professional I work with thought the discarding of wearing a face mask, even when fully vaccinated was a huge mistake and the lax precautions were reckless.

I understand why people are tried of these precautions.  Who isn't.  But the fact remains that the Delta variant isn't going away. And it is a very aggressive, highly contagious virus.

Please wear a mask. 

Please get vaccinated.

Lives truly are at risk.

Thank you.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"The longer we drag this on, the more likely we are to keep seeing new deadlier and more contagious variants. Get vaccinated and wear a mask if you want to keep doing fun things. The virus needs bodies in which to mutate and create these new forms. The more we get vaccinated and wear masks, the less opportunity we give it to do so and the more we can enjoy our lives. Covid doesn’t go away just becuase you are tired of it.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"Interesting that CEOs are worried about the privacy of their employees when it comes to vaccination but they have no qualms about taking their blood and urine to see if they take drugs on their own time. If you have to prove you're not a drug addict before you get a job, why shouldn't you have to prove that you're not a disease vector before you get a job or sitting in an office with other people?",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,anti-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"I'm rapidly arriving at the opinion that we need another lockdown. Give everyone enough funds to survive for three weeks and time to prepare. Then, unless you are *truly* essential, you are ticketed massively for being out at all. It will be awful; but so is this.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,anti-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"The world we live in is different  and riskier than the one we lived in in 2019 and before. Today's choice is this: get a Covid  vaccine, or continue to live in a pandemic world with a mutating virus, a  lower life expectancy and higher risk of long-term disability. The choice is not between   1) a vaccine  and 2) a return to the old world.  These are riskier times, and we have to get a grip on it and adjust. Sure be nice if we get this pandemic under control before the next one hits.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,unclear,pro-mitigation
"Get a vaccine or get a pink slip.  
There is no playing games with this issue!!  COVID-19 kills people.  We now have a vaccine that protects you and the people around you from contracting COVID, falling ill, and possibly dying.  Get the vaccine, or find a job working from home.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
